#### This page is intended to list the commands for the bot
#### so no more filling the profile's about me section

#### This is radio bot
#### a controllable micspam bot created by [Headless](https://steamcommunity.com/id/HeadlessHorselessHorseman/)

## to get started here are some commands:
- !play (yt url / name)  --can take a few minutes depending on how long the video is
- !stop                         --stops the bot from micspamming
- !help                         --the bot explains this one for you
- !earrapeify                --makes the current song become earrape (Joke feature)
- !partyleader               --gives you party leader role (ONLY WORKS WHEN IN PARTY)
- !votelogs                  --toggles the vote logging feature (basically shows you who votes yes or no) (default is on) (Only takes effect when in party)
- !db (59-107)               --How loud or quiet the current song should be (can be used to reset the earrapeify command) (default is 86 (works best))
- !current                   --Displays the current song
- !spin (-30 - +30)          --how fast the bot spins
-
- !!If you type a command that doesnt exist (example: !hlep , !db 48) the bot will instead send an error!!
