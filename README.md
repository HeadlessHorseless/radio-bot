#### This page is intended to list the commands for the bot
#### so no more filling the profile's about me section

#### This is radio bot
#### a controllable micspam bot created by [Headless](https://steamcommunity.com/id/HeadlessHorselessHorseman/)

## to get started here are some commands:
- !play (yt url / name)  --can take a few minutes depending on how long the video is (Download speed is usually about 2MB/s but can drop to 0.1MB/s)
- !stop                         --stops the bot from micspamming
- !skip                         --skips the previous play request
- !help                         --the bot explains this one for you
- !earrapeify                   --makes the current song become earrape (Joke feature)
- !partyleader                  --gives you party leader role (ONLY WORKS WHEN IN PARTY)
- !votelogs                     --toggles the vote logging feature (basically shows you who votes yes or no) (default is on) (Only takes effect when in party)
- !db (59-107)                  --How loud or quiet the current song should be (can be used to reset the earrapeify command) (default is 86 (works best))
- !current                      --Displays the current song
- !spin (-30 - +30)             --how fast the bot spins
- !leave                        --Makes the bot leave
- !killbind                     --killbinds
- !queue (map name)             --makes the bot queue for a map (put no map for the bot to queue via preset (all maps)) (works best when in bot's party)
- !aa (settings)                --Changes the AA (SpinBot) (Overrides the !spin command)
- !kick (player)                --Need someone to kick a bot but you are on cooldown? Well we got the feature just for you!
- !class (classname)            --Tired of a spinning scout? maybe try a medic or a soldier. Changes the class of the bot
- !ping                         --If the bot is ignoring your requests do this command for the bot to respond, if no response wait a couple of minutes
- !medicbot                     --Makes the bot switch to medic and follow you
