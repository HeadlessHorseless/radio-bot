## The bots playlist has been moved over from default to "Radio Bot" meaning the sound requests have been mostly reset (minus Thats Life)

#### This is radio bot
#### a controllable micspam bot created by [Headless](https://steamcommunity.com/id/HeadlessHorselessHorseman/)

## to get started here are some commands:
- !play (yt url / title)  --can take a few minutes depending on how long the video is (Download speed is usually about 2MB/s but can drop to 0.1MB/s)
- !stop                         --stops the bot from micspamming
- !skip                         --skips the previous play request
- !help                         --the bot explains this one for you
- !earrapeify                   --makes the current song become earrape (Joke feature)
- !partyleader                  --gives you party leader role (ONLY WORKS WHEN IN PARTY)
- !votelogs                     --toggles the vote logging feature (basically shows you who votes yes or no) (default is on) (Only takes effect when in party)
- !db (59-107)                  --How loud or quiet the current song should be (can be used to reset the earrapeify command) (default is 86 (works best))
- !current                      --Displays the current song
- !spin (-30 - +30)             --how fast the bot spins
- !leave                        --Makes the bot leave
- !killbind                     --killbinds
- !queue (map name)             --makes the bot queue for a map (put no map for the bot to queue via preset (all maps)) (works best when in bot's party)
- !aa (settings)                --Changes the AA (SpinBot) (Overrides the !spin command) (leave blank for random)
- !kick (player)                --Need someone to kick a bot but you are on cooldown? Well we got the feature just for you!
- !class (classname)            --Tired of a spinning scout? maybe try a medic or a soldier. Changes the class of the bot
- !ping                         --If the bot is ignoring your requests do this command for the bot to respond, if no response wait a couple of minutes
- !medicbot                     --Makes the bot switch to medic and follow you (the bot can sometimes lock onto other teammates but the beam will stay on you) DISABLED FOR NOW
- !dlspeed                      --checks the current download speed
- !ignoreme                     --sets you on the bot ignore list (useless if you are friend with bot) (due to the fact that headlessbots and lodbots use the exact same cheat you can use this for free headlessbot and lodbot immunity)
- !sniperbot                    --makes the bot switch to sniper and do bot things (might get the bot kicked) (you can combine this with !class for scout bot, heavy bot, etc) (DISABLED FOR NOW)
- !addfriend                    --The bot will automaticly add you as a friend (useful if you cant add people)
- !partycrash                   --crashes everyone in the party (joke feature) (not tested)
- !playlist (playlist name)     --plays either the entire bot playlist (requests and default) or a specific one (found here)
- !rejoin                       --makes the bot rejoin after someone uses !leave (requires a party member to be ingame)
- !name                         --changes the name of the bot (stays until the bot's game closes)
- !joinserver (server ip)       --makes the bot join a server (I'd like it if you keep the bot away from community servers 99% of the time (so the bot doesnt get banned, the bot will not accept !sniperbot/!medicbot requests on community servers) (prefix also changes to ? example: ?play))
- !chatspam (option)            --makes the bot spam chat from default presets (Accepted presets: lmaobox, cathook, fedoraware) (request)
- !avatar (image link)          --changes the pfp of the bot (use !avatar default to return to the default)
- .
-
- !!If you type a command that doesnt exist (example: !hlep , !db 48) the bot will instead send an error!!

## other stuff
- total amount of radio bots: 1
- once VAC Banned these bots will cease to exist unless someone else decides to make some
- The default song the bot plays upon joining is usually the last one picked if not, dicky needles will play
- The bot doesnt leave spawn unless it has to and will most likely start spinning just cause
- The bot can also call votekicks on other bots
- You are free to add the bot to your party whenever
- commands are also compatible in party chat
- The bot will requeue once the match is considered "dead" (bot filled matches or empty matches)
- The bot saves every song you request straight to this repository's release section
- every song saved into this repository does not need to download them so switching is almost instant
- The bot's region is EU
- If the bot is online and not seemingly doing anything it means either i logged into the bot to check on stuff or the bot is prepping to launch the game

> the bot's base is NOT avalible for download anywhere.
